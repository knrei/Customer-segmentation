k-Prototypes Algorithm

so, what is the k-Prototypes Algorithm?
k-Prototypes Algorithm is one of cluster method you can use for data partition or segmentation. This algorithm is a improvement of k-means algorithm which cam handle not only numerical data but also categorical data. The k-prototypes algorithm is practically more useful because frequently encountered data in real world databases are mixed-typed data (numerical data and categorical data).
